    "# Matrix Operations with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning tasks will require us to perform operations on vectors, matrices, and tensors. TensorFlow will obviously have good support for these types of operations (tensor is in the name!). We will create a TensorFlow graph to perform a dot product on a matrix and a vector. One of the most common issues when create deep learning models is that the shapes of the various matrices and tensors are not compatible. This example will get us thinking about those shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start out with two place holders here. This time we will define the shapes in an interesting way. Remember performing a dot product with an mxn matrix and a nx1 vector will produce a mx1 vector. It is only necessary for the number of columns in the matrix to match the number of rows in the vector. TensorFlow can make use of this and allow to set the m dimension to an arbitrary value, allow us to pass a matrix with any number of rows into that placeholder. This comes into play when we do mini-batch gradient descent becuase we will be able to change the batch size without having to change the computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "By putting in `None` as an argument in the shape parameter, this allows TensorFlow the freedom to receive a matrix with an arbitrary number of rows for that placeholder. The only shape constraint that we have here is that the second dimension of the matrix must match the first dimension of the vector."
